# B.Tech-Project

My btech project is " Classification and Aesthetic Evaluation of Paintings and Artworks". The main aim of my project is to classify the paintings into different categories and then evaluate the aethetic value of the painting. Aesthetic value means on a sclae of 1 to 10 we will rate painting on the basis of how the paintings looks by color, how much it is attracting you, how you are emotionally attched with this painting.
